README Othello

Overview:
    This program runs a game of Othello. It has a two top level classes which are
    PaneOrganizer and Controls.
    - The PaneOrganizer class contains an instance of the board and controls, which
    start the game
    - The Controls class creates new instances of the SetupGame and board in order to
    make new games and apply certain settings. It also contains many updating labels.
    - In the SetupGame class, there is a method which creates the instances of the
    Players, either human or computer.
    - The referee class controls a timeline which controls turn taking in the game.
    - The human player makes a move based on mouseclick
    - The computer player makes a move based on best move determined by a miniMax
    algorithm.

Design Choices:
    - I used a timeline so that the Computer can be delayed when making a move and
    we can see it
    - I used methods which served multiple purposes instead of making different,
    redundant ones. For example, the checkValidMove method can also flip pieces
    depending on a boolean passed through.
    - There is a MiniMax AI algorithm within the computer player which allows for
    various levels of AI in the game.

Extra Features:
    - Non-deterministic MiniMax Algorithm (not same outcome every time :))
    - Displays last move made by player
    - Can change border color
